```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(Sleuth3)
library(broom)
```

```{r}
Stockreturns <- c(-8.36, 1.63, -2.27, -2.93, -2.70,
-2.93, -9.14, -2.64, 6.82, -2.35,
-3.58, 6.13, 7.00, -15.25, -8.66,
-1.03, -9.16, -1.25, -1.22, -10.27,

Stockreturns

```

1) Use and show R code to find the mean of the sample data.
```{r}
mean(Stockreturns)
```

2) Use and show R code to find the standard deviation of the sample data
```{r}
sd(Stockreturns)
```

3) Assuming a normal distribution, use and show R code to find the proportion of returns that are less than -1.5.

```{r}
pnorm(q = -1.5, mean = -1.124615, sd = 5.977673)

```

4) Assuming a normal distribution, use and show R code to find return value that is above 70% of the returns
```{r}
qnorm(p = 0.70, mean = -1.124615, sd =5.977673)
```

5) Use and show R code to find Q1 for the data.
    - -3.255 
```{r}
summary(Stockreturns)
```

6) Explore the data by producing and examining a boxplot and checking for normality.
```{r}
boxplot(Stockreturns)
 qqnorm(Stockreturns)
 qqline(Stockreturns)
```

7) State the appropriate null and alternative hypothesis required for the appropriate t test.
    - H(0) :  population mean = .0095
    - H(A) :  population mean less than .0095
    
8) Use and show R code that will output the needed p value and confidence interval to determine if the null hypothesis
should be rejected.
```{r}
t.test(Stockreturns,mu=.0095, alternative = "less", conf.level = .95)
```

9) Now answer the question originally stated. Does the broker perform worse than average? (Explain or justify in two or three sentences)
    -  The broker does not perform worse than average because the p-value in our T-test is greater than .05 and 0 is in our confidence interval. Therefore there is not enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and prove that the broker performed worse than average.
